# Let Me Introduce Myself

Since an early age, I have been close to a computer, and have been passionate about it ever since.

As I have a strong passion in technology as a whole, my future ambition is to utilise technology to make the 
lives of people easier and to also help businesses in terms of automation and decision making. I also hope that the work 
that I do, will help in making an impact for myself as well as others. Looking forward, I wish to continue growing and challenging myself by joining the emerging world of technology.

I am especially interested in **Machine Learning**, **Data Analytics**, **Big Data Management** and **Web & Mobile Development**.

When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some videos on YouTube, or if the weather's good, go for a jog! 🏃‍♀️
